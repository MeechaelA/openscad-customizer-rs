# OpenSCAD Customizer Deserializer/Serializer in Rust
This is an interface to the OpenSCAD Customizer.

Concept:
Deserialize OpenSCAD customizer parameter file
Give Rust source code ability to change parameters in parameter file
Serialize OpenSCAD Customizer Parameter file from Rust source code
At this point you should be able to call the OpenSCAD binary to generate your model
