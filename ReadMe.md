# OpenSCAD Customizer Deserializer/Serializer in Rust
This is an interface to the OpenSCAD Customizer.

## Concept:
1. Deserialize OpenSCAD customizer parameter file
1. Give Rust source code ability to change parameters in parameter file
1. Serialize OpenSCAD Customizer Parameter file from Rust source code
1. At this point you should be able to call the OpenSCAD binary to generate your model
